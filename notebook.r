The company's director of marketing believes that increasing the number of yearly subscriptions is crucial for the long-term success of the company. To achieve this goal, my marketing analyst team, also hypothetical, must understand why casual riders would want to become members, and how annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently from occasional riders.\nTo gain insights that can guide the development of the new marketing strategy, we plan to analyze past bike trip data from Cyclistic. Our aim is to identify patterns and insights that can help us produce compelling data visualizations and expert insights. These visualizations and insights will be used to convince Cyclistic's management to approve the new marketing strategy.\n\n```{r Clear Environment}\nrm(list=ls()) # Caution: this clears the Environment\n```\n\n\n## Preparing Data\n\n#### Data Sources & Description\n\nThe primary data source for this project is historical bicycle trip data from Cyclistic, which can be downloaded via the provided link, https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.

recommendations for Cyclistic to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members:\nOffer discounts: Provide discounts to encourage casual riders to become annual members. Since casual riders use the bikes for longer periods, offering them a discount on the annual membership could be a cost-effective way to incentivize them to switch to an annual membership.\nPromote benefits of annual membership: Highlight the benefits of annual membership, such as cheaper fares, to persuade casual riders to become annual members. Cyclistic could use various marketing channels, such as email campaigns and social media, to educate casual riders about the benefits of annual membership and why it makes sense to switch.\nTarget busiest days and stations: Since Sundays and Mondays are the days when casual riders use the bikes the most, Cyclistic could\ntarget these days with a special promotion or discount for annual membership sign-ups. Similarly, since the busiest stations are used most by casual riders, Cyclistic could target these stations with promotional offers that encourage casual riders to upgrade to an annual membership.\n\nOverall, the focus should be on providing attractive incentives for casual riders to become annual members, while also highlighting the benefits of annual membership and targeting the busiest days and stations with promotional offers.\n","metadata":{}}]}
